= Aqueduct

+Aqueduct+ performs sandboxing on HTML, CSS and Embeds. 

To install, do:

copy aqueduct plugin to vendor/plugins

== HTML sandboxing

* Append something in front of id's
* Rails sanitization: Removes bad HTML with Rails's built-in sanitize method. Bad tags are removed completely, including their content.

== Usage

 class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
   html_sanitizer :field_name, :append => "sandbox"   #=> id's will be appended with sandbox_
 end



== CSS sandboxing
== Usage

 class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
   css_sanitizer :field_name, :append => "network_"  #=> CSS selectors will be appended with #network_
 end


== Unique features

* Rails 2.1-ready.
* It works with migrations. Columns are fetched when model is saved, not when the class is loaded.
